<h1>F1 Replay Timing</h1>


A web app for watching Formula 1 sessions with real timing data, car positions on track, driver telemetry, and more - both live during race weekends and as replays of past sessions. Built with Next.js and FastAPI.

## Features

- **Live timing** (Beta) - connect to live F1 sessions during race weekends with real-time data from the F1 SignalR stream, including a broadcast delay slider and automatic detection of post-session replays
- **Track map** with real-time car positions from GPS telemetry, updating every 0.5 seconds with smooth interpolation, marshal sector flags, and toggleable corner numbers
- **Driver leaderboard** showing position, gap to leader, interval, last lap time, sector indicators (qualifying/practice), tyre compound and age, tyre history, pit stop count and live pit timer, grid position changes, fastest lap indicator, investigation/penalty status, and sub-1-second interval highlighting
- **Race control messages** - steward decisions, investigations, penalties, track limits, and flag changes displayed in a draggable overlay on the track map with optional sound notifications
- **Pit position prediction** estimates where a driver would rejoin if they pitted now, with predicted gap ahead and behind, using precomputed pit loss times per circuit with Safety Car and Virtual Safety Car adjustments
- **Telemetry** for unlimited drivers showing speed, throttle, brake, gear, and DRS (2025 and earlier) plotted against track distance, with a moveable side panel for 3+ driver comparisons
- **Lap Analysis** (Beta) compare lap times for up to two drivers with a line chart and lap-by-lap history, with pit stop and safety car periods highlighted. Race replay only
- **Picture-in-Picture** mode for a compact floating window with track map, race control, leaderboard, and telemetry
- **Broadcast sync** - match the replay to a recording of a session, either by uploading a screenshot of the timing tower (using AI vision) or by manually entering gap times
- **Weather data** including air and track temperature, humidity, wind, and rainfall status
- **Track status flags** for green, yellow, Safety Car, Virtual Safety Car, and red flag conditions
- **Playback controls** with 0.5x to 20x speed, skip buttons (5s, 30s, 1m, 5m), lap jumping, a progress bar, and red flag countdown with skip-to-restart
- **Session support** for races, qualifying, sprint qualifying, and practice sessions from 2016 onwards
- **Full screen mode** hides the session banner and enters browser fullscreen for a distraction-free view
- **Imperial units** toggle for °F and mph in settings
- **Passphrase authentication** to optionally restrict access when publicly hosted

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) with Tailwind CSS — built as static files, served by the backend
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) — serves the API, WebSocket endpoints, and the frontend from a single port
- **Data Source**: [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1) (used during data processing only)

Everything runs as a **single container on one port**. The frontend and backend are the same service — no cross-origin configuration, no CORS, no separate URLs to manage.

Session data is processed once and stored locally (or in Cloudflare R2 for persistence). You can either pre-compute data in bulk ahead of time, or let the app process sessions on demand when you select them.

## Self-Hosting Guide

### Quick start (Docker)

Requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose.

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd f1live
```

**2. Configure:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` — the defaults work out of the box. Change `PORT` if you want a different port.

**3. Run:**

```bash
docker compose up
```

Open http://localhost:8000. Select any past session and it will be processed on demand.

The app runs as a single container on one port — no URL configuration required.

### Configuration

All configuration is managed through the `.env` file. No need to edit `docker-compose.yml`

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8000` | Port the app runs on |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Where session data is stored |
| `STORAGE_MODE` | `local` | `local` stores data on disk, `r2` reads from Cloudflare R2 |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` | | Cloudflare R2 account ID (only for `r2` mode) |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | | Cloudflare R2 access key (only for `r2` mode) |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | | Cloudflare R2 secret key (only for `r2` mode) |
| `R2_BUCKET_NAME` | `f1timingdata` | R2 bucket name |
| `AUTH_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable passphrase authentication |
| `AUTH_PASSPHRASE` | | Required passphrase when auth is enabled |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | | Enables photo sync feature ([get a key](https://openrouter.ai/)) |

### Reverse Proxy / Remote Access

The app serves everything (frontend, API, WebSocket) from a single port. Point your reverse proxy at the container port.

**Traefik:**
```yaml
services:
  f1timing:
    image: ghcr.io/adn8naiagent/f1replaytiming:latest
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - f1data:/data
      - f1cache:/data/fastf1-cache
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.f1timing.rule=Host(`f1.example.com`)
      - traefik.http.routers.f1timing.entrypoints=websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.f1timing.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt
      - traefik.http.services.f1timing.loadbalancer.server.port=8000
```

**nginx:**
```nginx
server {
    server_name f1.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

**Cloudflare Tunnel:**
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000
```

**Key points:**
- Single service, single port. No separate backend URL to configure
- WebSocket and HTTP are on the same origin. TLS termination works automatically
- No CORS headers needed. The frontend and API are the same service
- No `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` or `FRONTEND_URL` variables to set

### Accessing from other devices on your network

Set `PORT` in your `.env` if needed, then access via your machine's IP:

```
http://192.168.1.50:8000
```

No other configuration required. The app uses relative URLs, so it works on any address.

### Pre-built Docker images

You can also use pre-built images instead of building from source:

```bash
# Pull and run directly
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env -v f1data:/data -v f1cache:/data/fastf1-cache ghcr.io/adn8naiagent/f1replaytiming:latest
```

Or with docker-compose:

```yaml
services:
  f1timing:
    image: ghcr.io/adn8naiagent/f1replaytiming:latest
    ports:
      - "${PORT:-8000}:8000"
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - f1data:/data
      - f1cache:/data/fastf1-cache

volumes:
  f1data:
  f1cache:
```

### Cloud hosting (Railway, Vercel, Render, Fly.io, etc.)

Deploy as a single service. Most platforms will detect the `Dockerfile` at the project root automatically.

Set your environment variables in the platform's dashboard. R2 credentials are recommended since most cloud platforms have ephemeral filesystems, so locally computed session data would be lost on redeploy.

### Session data

Session data is persisted in a Docker volume, so it survives restarts.

**On-demand processing:** Simply select any past session from the homepage. If the data hasn't been processed yet, the app will automatically fetch and process it. The first load of a session takes **1-3 minutes**. After that, it's instant.

**Bulk pre-compute:** Use the CLI script to process sessions ahead of time:

```bash
# Process a specific race weekend
docker compose exec f1timing python precompute.py 2026 --round 1

# Process only the race session (skip practice/qualifying)
docker compose exec f1timing python precompute.py 2026 --round 1 --session R

# Process an entire season (will take several hours)
docker compose exec f1timing python precompute.py 2025 --skip-existing

# Process multiple years
docker compose exec f1timing python precompute.py 2016 2017 2018 --skip-existing
```

**Timing estimates:**
- A single session (e.g. one race) takes **1-3 minutes**
- A full race weekend (FP1, FP2, FP3, Qualifying, Race) takes **3-5 minutes**
- A complete season (~24 rounds, all sessions) takes **2-3 hours**

The app also includes a background task that automatically checks for and processes new session data on race weekends (Friday-Monday).

### Manual setup (without Docker)

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+

#### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd F1timing
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

#### 2. Build the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

This produces static files in `frontend/out/`.

#### 3. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
STATIC_DIR=../frontend/out uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000.

### Photo Sync Feature

The broadcast sync feature lets you match the replay to a recording of a session. You can always sync manually by entering gap times directly. To also enable photo/screenshot sync (where the app reads the timing tower from an image), set an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API key as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. It uses a vision model (Gemini Flash) to read the leaderboard from the photo. Any OpenRouter-compatible API key will work.
